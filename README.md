The only purpose of this is to make [git-prompt.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keithbowes/git/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh) usable with just about any shell instead of just with Bash/zsh. This is done in various ways, such as avoiding the use of `local` (instead `unset` is used when a variable is no longer needed) and using `tput` instead of shell-specific ways to set text attributes. If you want to use another shell and still use git-prompt.sh, this is for you. In any case, use the upstream code for the actual Git program, as this fork represents a very old fork of the Git program itself (this fork's only purpose is to make git-prompt.sh portable).
